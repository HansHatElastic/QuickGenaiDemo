# QuickGenaiDemo
 This is for setting up an index template plus pipeliness for rapid manual loading some docs for the playground using the E5 model. Code is derived from a web crawler.
 
Note that only the "body_content" from the input doc is picked up for inference !

Objective: if you need some data for the playground demo, and for reasons the source docs are hard to get or crawl you can add manually a small set of docs. This is not "best practices production code"
