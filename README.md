# QuickGenaiDemo
 Rapid manual loading some docs for the playground using the E5 model. Code is derived from a web crawler.
 Note that only the "body_content" from the input doc is picked up for inference. 

 Objective: if you want to do a playground demo, and for reasons the source docs are hard to get or crawl you can add manually a small set of docs. So this is for demo purposes only, not for production.
